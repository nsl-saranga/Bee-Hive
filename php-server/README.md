Include Configuration File: The script includes a configuration file named "config.php". This file likely contains database connection details or other configurations necessary for the script to function.

get_hive_unit_id Function: This function is defined to retrieve the ID of a hive unit based on the API key provided. It queries the database to find a matching API key and returns the corresponding unit ID.

Retrieve API Key from Request Header: It retrieves the API key from the request header HTTP_API_KEY.

Validate API Key: The script validates the API key by calling the get_hive_unit_id function. If the API key is not valid (not found in the database), it returns a 401 Unauthorized response and terminates the script execution.

Read JSON Data from Request Body: It reads the JSON data from the request body using file_get_contents('php://input') and decodes it into an associative array using json_decode.

Validate JSON Structure: It checks whether the JSON data contains the expected keys: 'temp', 'hum', and 'weight'. If the structure is invalid, it returns a 400 Bad Request response and terminates the script execution.

Prepare Data for Database Insertion: The script explicitly defines variables $temp, $hum, and $weight based on the decoded JSON data.

Insert Data into the Database: It prepares an SQL statement to insert data into the database table named "hive_data" with columns unit_id, temp, hum, and weight. The data to be inserted includes the unit ID obtained from the API key validation step and the values for temperature, humidity, and weight. The SQL statement is prepared and executed using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Handle Exceptions: It catches any exceptions that occur during the database insertion process and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response along with an error message.

Return Success Response: If the data insertion is successful, it returns a 200 OK response along with a success message.

This script essentially acts as an API endpoint for receiving data from hive units, validates the incoming data and API key, and stores the data into a database for further processing or analysis.
